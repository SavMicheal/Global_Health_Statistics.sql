# Global Health Statistics 

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of a large-scale global health dataset using **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)**. With over **1 million rows** and **22 fields**, the dataset offers valuable insights into global health indicatorsâ€”ranging from disease prevalence and mortality rates to hospital infrastructure and healthcare outcomes. The analysis helps pinpoint the most affected country, uncover root causes, and propose practical remedies.

## Project Objectives

- Identify the **country most affected** by health-related issues.
- Analyze the **underlying causes** of poor health outcomes in that country.
- Explore **potential remedies** and data-backed **recommendations** to improve public health.
- Evaluate the **availability of hospital beds** across countries as a metric for healthcare infrastructure.

## Dataset Overview

- **Size:** 1 million records  
- **Fields:** 22 columns including:

---

## Key Analyses Performed

- Data cleaning, deduplication, and standardization
- Identification of top causes of death by country and region
- Ranking of countries by mortality rate and healthcare performance
- Analysis of hospital bed availability per 1,000 people
- Derivation of actionable insights to guide public health strategies

## Insights & Findings

- **Nigeria** emerged as the most impacted country, with a **mortality rate of 8.62%**, primarily driven by **high infection rates caused by COVID-19**.
- As of **2024**, there was a **significant shortage of hospital beds**, with only **340 beds available**, highlighting critical gaps in healthcare infrastructure.

## Recommendations

### Strengthen Healthcare Infrastructure

- **Expand hospital capacity** by increasing the number of hospital beds, especially in **high-density urban** and **underserved rural areas**.
- Encourage **public-private partnerships** to build **modular or emergency healthcare facilities** during pandemics or crises.

### Implement Nationwide Preventive Health Campaigns

- Launch **intensive awareness and vaccination campaigns** to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and prevent future outbreaks.
- Promote **hygiene practices**, **early testing**, and **health education** through targeted **community outreach programs**.
